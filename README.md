## 💡 The Problem & The Solution

Across Africa, while fitness culture is growing, formal incentives and ownership over personal health data remain sparse. Health and activity data generated by individuals often remains siloed, unrewarded, and inaccessible for personal economic benefit.

**Runft** solves this by creating a dynamic **Fitness-to-NFT (F2N) platform**. We turn physical activity—specifically running—into **unique generative Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**.

By leveraging blockchain and GPS data, Runft:
1.  **Incentivizes Activity:** Converts physical exertion into tangible, tradable digital wealth, fostering healthier communities.
2.  **Empowers Ownership:** Gives individuals sovereign control over their fitness data, turning runs into collectible and marketable assets.
3.  **Drives Local Engagement:** The system can be adapted to reward running in specific 'FitZones' tied to local community health goals.

Runft is building a decentralized, tokenized fitness economy, starting with the immense potential of African health and tech innovation.

## 🔥 Power Hacks 2025: AI-Driven Agents & Blockchain Tracks

Runft is a prime example of decentralized intelligence, combining off-chain activity data with on-chain value creation, directly addressing the core Power Hacks 2025 themes:

| Track | Achievement | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Decentralized Intelligence** | Uses immutable, real-world GPS and temporal data (Strava API/GPS) to deterministically generate unique NFT art and metadata, a form of on-chain data analysis and decentralized intelligence. | *Generative NFT logic uses run details (route, timestamp) as seed data for uniqueness.* |
| **Blockchain for Good (HealthTech)** | Tokenizes fitness achievement, providing tangible, verifiable rewards that encourage physical activity and foster better health outcomes across African nations. | *Core contracts deployed on **Arbitrum Sepolia** ensure verifiable asset provenance and trade.* |
| **Innovative Web3 Utility** | A fully functional Move-to-Earn dApp featuring a generative NFT minting engine and integrated marketplace, pioneering a new use case for collectibles in the fitness sector. | *The system handles wallet connection, Strava sync, NFT generation, and trading/showcasing.* |

## ⚙️ How It Works: Minting a Digital Footprint

1.  **Connect Wallet** → Secure login via an EVM-compatible wallet.
2.  **Sync Strava/GPS** → Seamlessly connect your preferred running app to import run details.
3.  **Go for a Run** → Distance, route geometry, and timestamp are captured by the backend.
4.  **Generate NFT** → The unique run data is fed into a deterministic algorithm to create unique digital art and mint a collectible NFT on-chain.
5.  **Marketplace** → The newly minted Runft can be instantly bought, sold, and showcased, giving immediate, liquid value to fitness achievements.
